For the entirity of my professional career, I have always worked in a retail environent. The busy, fast paced work and environment has always appealed to me. I worked my way up in the management chains of all of my prior jobs due to my determination and drive to help customers to the best of my ability. In time, the long hours, busy holiday seasons, and hectic schedules has taken its toll on me and opened my eyes to other career opportunities. 

I had always had a curiosity for coding and always wanted to learn more about it. I was always drawn to video games and was always amazed and appreciative of all the work that goes into making games. The same could be said about all of the apps that we use in our day-to-day lives.  My husband, who has always wanted me to grow and better myself, found Flatiron School as a way for me to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes of all of the software that we use. When I started with the program, it was hard for me to budget my time accordingly between working my 40+ hour work week and learning to code. Now, I am ready to start fresh and commit myself to learning how to code.

To me, learning is very important. It is important to continuously grow and better yourself. Through Flatiron School, I plan on flourishing and making my way into the Software Development field!
